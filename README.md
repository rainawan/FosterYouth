# FosterYouth
Final Project of Snap Academies 2022

Our team found that foster youth have incredible stories to share, but no platform that nurtures a sense of community. YouBelong is a Snap Mini platform that fosters an environment of authenticity, self-expression, and happiness. We used React Native for the front end and Firebase to store images and videos for the backend.

Run Project

Step 1: `yarn install`
